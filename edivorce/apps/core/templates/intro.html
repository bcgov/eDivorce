    <h5><strong>*Joint Divorce Only</strong></h5>
    <p>
        Joint divorce means making an application for a divorce together with your spouse. It means that you and your
        spouse agree about getting a divorce and that you agree about all of the family law issues relevant to your
        situation, such as spousal support, and the division of family property and debts.
