    <p>Some divorces are more complicated than others, and not everyone should use this online tool.
        So let's start by asking you a few questions to make sure that this website is right for your situation.</p>

<div class="question-well">
    <h3>Will you be able to provide proof of your marriage (in the form of an original or certified

    </div>

    <p>The marriage certificate you received at the church — or any other place where you were married — isn't
        acceptable in court. You need the certificate that was issued to you by the government.</p>

                If you were married in B.C. you can get your marriage certificate or a certified copy of the registration of marriage from
                <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=1CC89B10AE964BFABB99D1A4AADC38BF" target="_blank">Vital Statistics</a>

            <p><strong>If You Were Married in Another Province</strong><br />
            If you were married in another province you need to get the official marriage certificate or registration of marriage
                from the office equivalent to the Department of Vital Statistics in that province.</p>

            <p><strong>If You Were married in Another Country</strong><br />

                If you can't get your marriage certificate before your case begins, state that on the court forms and explain why.

                is satisfied that you had a good reason for not filing this document sooner. If the court registrar is dissatisfied
                with your reason for not filing your marriage certificate,
                you will be unable to file your claim for divorce until the document can be produced.

            will be reviewed by the court. Other matters can be pursued in the mean time.</p>
        <p>If the registrar is dissatisfied with the reason(s) you provide, you will not be able to file

        <p><strong>Proof of Marriage Translation</strong><br />
            You need to get your proof of marriage translated by a certified translator if it is not in English.
            Ask the translator to give you an Affidavit of Translation.
            You'll then need to file at the court registry both the original Marriage Certificate or Registration of Marriage and the
            {% include "partials/tooltips/forms/affidavit_of_translation.html" with text="Affidavit of Translation" %}
            with the English translation attached as exhibits.
            A certified translator can help you do this.</p>
