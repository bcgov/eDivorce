    Parental/Decision-Making Responsibilities
{% endblock %}

{% block inner %}
    The responsibilities guardians have for the children in their care, including decisions about daily care, education, religious upbringing,
    extracurricular activities, etc. After separation or divorce, guardians can share parental/decision-making responsibilities in whatever
    way that's in the child's best interests, as decided by agreement or court order.
    <br /><br />
    When a child's parents live together, both parents are the child's guardians (have guardianship).
    When the parents separate, both parents continue to be guardians unless they agree to change this or a court orders a change.
    A court can give guardianship of a child to a non-parent.
    Guardians are responsible for making all decisions about their child, including about daily care and supervision, education, health care,
    cultural or religious upbringing, and where the child will live.
