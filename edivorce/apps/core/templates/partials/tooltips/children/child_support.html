    Child Support
{% endblock %}

{% block inner %}
    Parents have a duty under the law to support their children,
    even if one parent doesn't see or take care of the children.
    The money one parent pays to the other parent to help provide
    for the daily needs of the children is called child support or
    maintenance.
