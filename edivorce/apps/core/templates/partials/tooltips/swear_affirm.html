                <b>Swear/Affirm</b>
                <br /><br />
                An &quot;affidavit&quot; is a written document that contains facts that you must swear under oath (usually on a Bible or other religious book) or affirm
        (non-religious promise) to be true. After you swear or affirm, the affidavit is evidence of the facts it sets out, just as if you took the
        stand in a courtroom to provide those facts.
        <br/>
        To swear or affirm an affidavit, you must meet with a commissioner for taking oaths. The
        commissioner (often a lawyer, notary public or registry clerk) will check your photo id to make sure you are who you say you are, ask you if
        you understand the contents of your affidavit, then ask you to swear or affirm that the contents are true. The commissioner will then watch
        you sign the document before signing it themselves.">
