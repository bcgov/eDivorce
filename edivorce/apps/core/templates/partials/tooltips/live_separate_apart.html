    Living Separate and Apart
{% endblock %}

{% block inner %}
    You or your spouse have decided to end the marriage. In
        general one separates by moving out. However, it is possible
        to be separated but still live under the same roof as long as
        either you or your spouse have clearly communicated your
        intention for a permanent separation (and are starting to act
        upon it).
    <br><br>
    This could mean:
    <ul>
        <li>You're living in separate rooms</li>
        <li>You're sleeping in separate beds</li>
        <li>There's no sexual relationship</li>
    </ul>
