    Collusion
{% endblock %}

{% block inner %}
    Basically this statement confirms that you and your spouse haven’t lied or tried to deceive the court
    in any way (for example, saying that you’ve been separated for longer than you have been).
    It is a legal requirement that you confirm you are providing accurate and complete information.
