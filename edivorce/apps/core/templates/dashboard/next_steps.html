        at the registry counter:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You will need to wait for the registry to notify you indicating if your documents
            have been accepted and the divorce order granted, or if corrections are required.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have received your filed order for divorce and 31 days has passed, you can
            now submit your request for a Certificate of Divorce.
        </li>
        <li>
            If corrections are required, you will need to make the corrections to the documents
            noted by the registry and resubmit them.
        </li>

        <b><i>I have submitted all documents online</i></b> (except the Certificate of Divorce):

    <ul>
        <li>
            You will be notified by email when your documents have been reviewed and processed

            filed or if corrections are needed for filing.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the documents have been filed, you will be able to access the filed documents using
            the link in the email notification. You will want to confirm that the order for divorce
            is filed and then you can proceed to submit your Certificate of Divorce.
        </li>
        <li>
            If corrections are required, you will need to make the corrections to your document(s)
            and then resubmit to the registry.
