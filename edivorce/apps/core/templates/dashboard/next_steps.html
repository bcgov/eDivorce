            The court registry staff will check your documents to make sure they've been completed properly.

        <p>
            If you're not sure whether you've filled out the documents correctly, get some

            If the court registry is satisfied that your documents are in order, they will stamp the documents with the date, the court seal, and a
            file number.

        <b><i>I have manually submitted all documents</i></b> (except the Certificate of Divorce)
        at the registry counter:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You will need to wait for the registry to notify you indicating if your documents
            have been accepted and the divorce order granted, or if corrections are required.
        </li>
        <li>
            If you have received your filed order for divorce and 31 days has passed, you can
            now submit your request for a Certificate of Divorce.
        </li>
        <li>
            If corrections are required, you will need to make the corrections to the documents
            noted by the registry and resubmit them.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <b><i>I have submitted all documents online</i></b> (except the Certificate of Divorce):

    <ul>
        <li>
            You will be notified by email when your documents have been reviewed and processed
            by registry staff. The notification will indicate whether your documents have been
            filed or if corrections are needed for filing.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the documents have been filed, you will be able to access the filed documents using
            the link in the email notification. You will want to confirm that the order for divorce
            is filed and then you can proceed to submit your Certificate of Divorce.
        </li>
        <li>
            If corrections are required, you will need to make the corrections to your document(s)
            and then resubmit to the registry.
