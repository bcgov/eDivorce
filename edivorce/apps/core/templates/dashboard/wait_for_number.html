            In order to complete your divorce you’ll need to file the final set of documents.
            To do this you’ll require a {% include "partials/tooltips/court_file_number.html" %}
            which will be provided from the Court Registry once they have reviewed and approved
            your initial filing. <b>This review can take up to a week to complete.</b>
            You'll receive an e-mail with details of your initial filing.
        </p>

            If you have any questions or concerns about your initial filing, please contact

    <h3>How long does it take to get a file number?</h3>
    <p>
        The time depends on how many filings are received at the court registry you are filing with.
        Normally, you will receive a file number within a week of submitting online.
        If you do not receive a file number, you can send an email to <a href="mailto:Courts.CSO@gov.bc.ca" target="_blank">CSO Support Helpdesk</a>.
        Please provide the package number and registry location you submitted your documents to
        and they will be able to help.
