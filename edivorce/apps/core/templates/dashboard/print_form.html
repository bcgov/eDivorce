        start a court case. On the next step you'll learn about how you can file
        the forms below along with any applicable attachments at a {% include "partials/tooltips/court_registry.html" %}.

                    The Notice of Joint Family Claim Form (F1) is a document that

                    for the divorce and gives information about you and your spouse,
                    as well as the details about your marriage and separation.

                    Take the Certificate to the court registry where you filed your
                    Notice of Trial. After you file it, the registrar will search
                    the file and sign and return the Certificate to you. If
                    something's missing, the registrar won't sign the Certificate

                <p>
                    If everything is in order, the Registrar will sign the

    <h3>Signing, Swearing and Completing Forms</h3>
    <p>
        This page lists all of the forms needed to file for divorce.
        Each form indicates what you'll need to do to get it ready for filing
        (submitting to the Court Registry).
    </p>
    <p>
        Those forms that require <b>Reviewing and Printing</b> are automatically created
        based on your answers in the questionnaire portion of this tool.
        Assuming the content is correct, they should be ready for filing without additional work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those that require <b>Reviewing, Printing and Signing</b> have also been automatically
        created based on your answers in the questionnaire portion of this tool but they do
        require you and your spouse's signature before filing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Those that require <b>Reviewing, Printing and Swearing</b> have been created for you based
        on your answers in the questionnaire but must be sworn / affirmed in front of a commissioner.
        You can learn more about this process on the Swear Forms step of this tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        The remaining <b>Additional Documents</b> are not created by this tool but are additional
        documents that will be required. You must complete the forms and attach them to your
        filing.
    </p>
