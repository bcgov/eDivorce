                    When a couple separates, one spouse may be eligible to
                    receive financial support from the other. This is called
                    spousal support. Spousal support is separate and distinct
                    from child support. Unlike child support, spousal support
                    is not a right in every case. You are entitled to spousal
                    support in certain situations.
                </p>
                <p>The objectives of spousal support are to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Deal with any economic advantages or disadvantages a spouse may face as a result of the relationship or separation
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Share the financial consequences arising from care of the children
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce the financial hardship a spouse will experience as a result of the separation, and
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Encourage each spouse to become financially self-sufficient within a reasonable period of time.

                    With an undefended divorce (aka desk order divorce) you do
                    not need to appear in court. However a judge needs to review
                    and approve what you are asking for. Orders allow you to tell
                    the court what you want (for example division of property
                    and debt, child support, spousal support, etc.).

<h3>What are Orders?</h3>
<p>
    An order is the record of the judge's decision. It is filed at the court
    registry. In Supreme Court, the parties involved in a case (or their
    lawyers) are responsible for telling the court the order(s) they want.
    This is done by putting the details in writing in their
    {% include "partials/tooltips/application.html" %}
    and in a {% include "partials/tooltips/draft_of_order.html" %} to be signed by the judge or
    {% include "partials/tooltips/master.html" %}.
    The judge or master who reviews the application will sign the order, if
    they approve it.
