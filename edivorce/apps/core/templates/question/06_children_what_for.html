                    Ok, you may be thinking, how the heck am I supposed to know which act (a written law) applies.
                    Let's see if we can help you identify which act best fits with your circumstances/situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Family Law Act and the Divorce Act overlap in some areas but not others. The Divorce Act
                    applies only if you're married but the Family Law Act can apply to both married and unmarried
                    couples. Even if you are getting a divorce, you must apply under the Family Law Act for the
                    division of property or debts, a family law protection order, or orders related to guardianship.
                    The Divorce Act does not deal with these.
                </p>
                <img src="{% static 'img/which_laws_apply.png' %}" />
                <p></p>
                <p>
                    There are big differences in how the Divorce Act and the Family Law Act deal with some issues,
                    especially parenting. For more information, see the fact sheet

    <p><strong>What does the law mean by &ldquo;best interests of the child&rdquo;?</strong></p>
    <p>
        The &ldquo;best interests of the child&rdquo; is a legal test used to decide what would best
        protect your child’s physical, psychological, and emotional safety, security and
        well-being. To determine what is in the child’s best interests when making parenting
        arrangements, you must consider factors including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The child’s emotional health and well-being</li>
        <li>The child’s views, unless it would be inappropriate to consider them</li>
        <li>The child’s relationships with parents, guardians, and other important people</li>
        <li>The history of care, and</li>
        <li>The impact of any family violence</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        When you make an agreement about parenting arrangements after a separation, the law says
        you must only consider the child’s best interests. And if you go to court, the judge can
        only consider the child’s best interests in making parenting orders. For more information
        on the
        <a href="https://familylaw.lss.bc.ca/resources/fact_sheets/bestInterestsOfChild.php" target="_blank">
            best interests of the child
        </a>
        please refer to the Family Law  in B.C. website.
    </p>
    <p><strong>The benefits of using both courts (Provincial Court, Supreme Court)</strong></p>
    <p>
        In some situations, you may find it best to use both courts. You could get most of your
        orders in Provincial Court, and then just apply for your divorce order in Supreme Court.
        (You could also choose to make an agreement about parenting, support, and property and
        then just apply to the Supreme Court for a divorce.) This approach might save you money
        and time, especially if you and your spouse agree on what should be done.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the other hand, it could make things more complicated to have to deal with two
        different courts. It can also be a problem if you ask more than one court to deal with
        issues about parenting and support.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>What should I consider when determining parenting arrangements?</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you and your <strong>spouse</strong> (married or unmarried) have dependent children
        (usually under age 19), you need to make arrangements for taking care of the children when you
        separate. <strong>Parenting arrangements</strong> include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>who will make decisions about the children,</li>
        <li>where the children are going to live, and </li>
        <li>how much time the children will spend with each parent who is a guardian.</li>
    </ul>
