                    <li>The type of parenting arrangements for the child or children, such as shared custody or split custody.</li>

                    <li>Special and extraordinary expenses, like childcare that aren’t covered in the table amount.</li>

                    If the child / children spends an equal amount of time in the care of each of you, or if both parents
                    are splitting custody of multiple children, the payor is likely the parent with the higher income.

        <p><strong>What is "undue hardship"?</strong></p>
        <p>
            The person paying or the person receiving child support can ask for a different amount than what's listed in
            the guidelines tables if that amount would cause them undue hardship. The payor may experience undue
            hardship trying to pay the child support, or the recipient may experience undue hardship trying to support
            the child or children with the amount given. The courts have said that "undue" means excessive, exceptional,
            or disproportionate. This can be a hard thing to prove. The person making the claim must report all income
            coming into their household, including any income or contribution from a new spouse or partner. This includes
            any contribution to household expenses, and any rental income, dividend income, investment income, and
            business income. If the payor makes this claim, the recipient must also provide information about their income.
        </p>
        <p><strong>How to determine undue hardship</strong></p>
        <p>
            To determine undue hardship under the Federal Child Support Guidelines, you need to compare the standards of
            living in both households. To do this, you need to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                calculate the income of every member of both households; adjust each person’s income according to the
                rules set out in the Federal Guidelines; and
            </li>
            <li>
                calculate the household income ratio.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The Federal Child Support Guidelines Step-by-Step Guide has a
            <a href="http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/fl-lf/child-enfant/guide/w3a-f3a.html#s3" target="_blank">worksheet</a> to help you with the calculation to
            figure out whether there is undue hardship in your situation.
