"""Values derived from a user's responses.

This module provides functions to take a set of responses from a user and create
a set of derived values that are consistent with the user's responses.  This is
done, in part, to centralize the logic for getting such derived values (such as
whether or not to show a particular fact sheet).

The general usage is to add to the context of a template by calling
``get_derived_data`` on the user responses and including the resulting dict
under the _derived_ key.
